Twenty Seconds Resume/CV

Original description:
This simple Resume/CV template features a large sidebar with key information about you neatly presented for quick perusal. Your main skills can be quickly highlighted using progress bars ranging from novice to expert, this is particularly useful for programming languages and other skills where time is required for mastery. The template body is then presented delimited by large colored section titles (alternating gray and blue). Inside these, you can further divide content by subsection or simply write paragraphs. Lists of achievements or timelines can be constructed using one of two environments: long lists with descriptions or short one-line lists. The template features commented code for making it into a two page Resume/CV where the document body simply continues onto the next page and the sidebar is displayed again on the second page.
